## Drizzle and React

just follow-along of the tutorial below
https://truffleframework.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-drizzle-and-react

### What is great?
The tutorial shows you how to separately install the latest create-react-app and make it work with Drizzle.

### What is missing and/or confusing?
It does not show how to combine the project with react-router.
Yet another way/more methods to interact with the smart contract...
